- use kebab-case for component filenames
- only use useMemo() useCallback() etc when it makes sense, dont unnecessarily add it to every function
- extract all reusable utility functions to a /utils file/folder
- use useContext() for feature-scoped config or state that stays within a single provider boundary
- use zustand for shared state or coordinated updates across multiple components/features
- prefer deriving render data directly from props/state; avoid redundant state and Effects
- handle user-driven logic in event handlers; use Effects only to sync with external systems
