- never use dynamic imports (unless asked to) like `await import(..)
- never cast to any
- do not add extra defensive checks or try/catch blocks
- do not redeclare types, create a single source of truth and import it
- do not use optional types, use explicit nullables instead (e.g., `string | null`)
- use zod to validate deserialized data
- trust typescript types, find missing types instead of guessing
- recheck files before consecutive edits, assume user changes are correct
- stop returning everything `as const` unless specified
